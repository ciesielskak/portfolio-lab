# React App for stuff donation 

## Check out at: https://sharp-hypatia-9f9274.netlify.app

**Main purpose**: After signing up, there's a form available to mark what, how much, to whom you'd like to donate your stuff and where to collect it. You can also send a message by filling out a basic form on the bottom of the page.


**Functions:**

* React Scroll
* Firestore database and authentication ( register and signIn )
* Form validation and sending data to Firestore
* Pagination with React Paginate
* State controlled with Context API

<ins>Note: Still adding some **RWD changes** and **fixing minor errors**.</ins>
